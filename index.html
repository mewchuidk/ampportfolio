        <h2> <i>Hello! I have been drawing for around 9 years, however I only began drawing digitally around 4 years ago.<br> I am a mainly self-taught artist, having spent 5 years developing my techniques.<br> I tend to stray from a realistic style that others are taught to draw in, <br> and leant further into a style that resembles cartoons. <br>I still have alot to learn, and look forward to improving as I gain more experience.  </i></h2>
